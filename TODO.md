# TODO

- improve xpath for download link
- check if wizard download page structure was changed https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24586619/how-to-check-if-a-domdocument-was-changed-with-a-simple-and-fast-comparison

## maybe

- also set additional ini values for xdebug, based on the php version or even all of them unconditionally (https://github.com/violinminds/knowledgebass/blob/main/php+vscode-xdebug-settings.md#phpini)
- use `select-string` instead of `findstr`
- use `-replace` instead of `php -r ...str_replace...`
